Hi! Welcome to my, Adrianna Westbrook's, github on binary prediction modeling through regression modeling. 

Although this page was originally created for CSP 2024, I plan to continuously update this repository with new information (at least new to me) as I continue my own learning journey into the wonderful world of binary prediction modeling. 

I would love to hear from you if you have any feedback or your own knowledge to share. 

Best wishes,
Adrianna
